Hi ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Matt and I am studying Computer Science while serving in the US Air Force. As I approach the end of my contract, I have started working on becoming a better web developer and programmer. I hope to begin a career in Software Engineering once I finish up my degree. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make responsive webpages as well as the JavaScript language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me grow!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything whether it be programming or my life in the military. I am an open book and love sharing experiences with others.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn. At the moment I am not too active on it yet as I am still building up my profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
